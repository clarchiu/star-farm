### About the Game

<img alt="player avatar" align="right" src="docs/player.png" width="15%">

A pixel art, resource management adventure taking inspiration from games like Minecraft, Stardew Valley, Factorio and Starbound! Take on the role of a daring astronaut stranded on an unfamiliar inhospitable planet.

### Gameplay 

Dive into a dangerous adventure! Collect and farm the 15 different metals found on the planet so that you can repair your ship and escape this planet.

</p>

But be careful! As you start to expand your farm around the planet, new monsters will start attacking your farm to steal your metals. Keep upgrading your weapon and build walls and turrets to fight against the waves of monsters.

The playerâ€™s multitool provides them with the means to alter the world around them. By breaking obstacles, building defences, and growing plants, the player has the means to make the world their own.
